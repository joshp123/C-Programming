TODO:

figure out if we have to declare array lengths (i.e. create and arbitraty limit) or if we can dynamically extend them

-- What you could do, is make them pointers to floats, and dynamically allocate memory and set the pointer to point at your new double-array
It's dirty
but works somehwat :(
Remember to clear the memory after you're done, though

document smart things like ignoring last blank line etc


set up portabl sublime-text w/gcc and build system

(and maybe portable git?)
